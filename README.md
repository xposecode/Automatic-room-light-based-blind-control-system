# Automatic-room-light-based-blind-control-system

  **Introduction:**

❖ Electricity is a limited and valuable resource, making it crucial to conserve energy and utilize natural sources like sunlight. This project presents an innovative approach to energy conservation by minimizing the use of electrically powered light sources and leveraging sunlight as a primary source of illumination. By adopting this eco-friendly initiative, we can not only reduce our reliance on electricity but also promote sustainable energy practices. This approach contributes significantly to energy conservation and supports environmental sustainability.

**Automatic-room-light-based-blind-control-system:**

➢ The aim of this project is to design sliding windows equipped with a blind control system that adjusts based on the intensity of sunlight. 

❖ By providing the right amount of light. 
❖ By providing that light when it is needed. 
 
➢ The system operates by adjusting the window blinds based on the intensity of sunlight. When sunlight is present, the blinds open proportionally to the light's intensity. This functionality is achieved using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), which automates the process. The LDR detects sunlight and controls the window mechanism, opening or closing the blinds accordingly.

➢ The core concept of this automated system is that the position of the blinds is directly dependent on the intensity of light. To implement this, we have utilized an Arduino microcontroller, which ensures seamless and precise control of the system.
