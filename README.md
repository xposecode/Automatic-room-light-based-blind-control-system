# Automatic-room-light-based-blind-control-system

  **Introduction:**

❖ It is very important to conserve electricity and utilize the natural soruce of energy as 
electricity is a limited resource of energy. The project describes a way to conserve 
electricity by not using light sources that works on electricity but to use sunlight as a 
prominent light source.It will be helpful to generate the energy and it is also eco-friendly. 
Most of the energy will be conserve due to this intiative.

**Principle Behind Mosquito Repellent Circuit:**

➢ The aim of the project is to design such sliding windows using blind control system. It 
will be using the intensity of the sunlight. ❖ By providing the right amount of light. 
❖ By providing that light when it is needed. 
 
➢ So, whenever there is sunlight outside it will be opening according to it. So,we 
can say that intensity of light coming from the sun is proportional to opening of 
window. We have used LDR to automate the house. LDR used to control the 
window as open/close when sun lights falls on to the LDR. The basic concept of 
our automated system is that the position of the blinds is dependent on the 
intensity of light. Here, we have used Arduino.

**LIMITATIONS OF CIRCUIT AND FUTURE WORK**

➢We can use the IOT(Internet of things) in future.
➢It requires a lot of frequency setting.
➢We can use this blind control system for more than one window.
   
**CONCLUSION**
➢This project presents an Automatic Room light intensity based on window blind control system which can detect the intensity of sunlight and to control the window as open/close when sun lights falls on to the LDR. I have concluded that the window opens according to the sunlight intensity. The results are perfectly upto the mark , it works as window blind control system.

**APPLICATION**

➢To use the solar form of energy.
➢To use the renewable enegy and convert into the mechanical energy.
